## Purpose

GROBID NER is a Named-Entity Recogniser based on the GROBID library ([grobid](https://raw.github.com/kermitt2/grobid)), a text mining tool exploiting CRF. The installation of GROBID is necessary.  

Grobid NER has been developed more specifically for the purpose of supporting disambiguation and resolution of the entities against knowledge bases such as Wikipedia. For a description of the NER, installation, usage and other technical features, see the [documentation](http://grobid-ner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
