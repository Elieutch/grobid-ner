GROBID NER identifies named-entities and classifies them in 26 classes, as compared to the 4-classes or 7-classes model of most of the existing NER open source tools (usually using the Reuters/CoNLL 2003 annotated corpus, or the MUC annotated corpus). 

In addition the entities are often enriched with WordNet sense annotations to help further disambiguation and resolution of the entity. GROBID NER has been developed for the purposed of disambiguating and resolving entities against knowledge bases such as Wikipedia and FreeBase. Sense information can help to disambiguate the entity, because they refine based on contextual clues the entity class.

## Named entity classes

## Conventions

For the class assignation to entities, GROBID NER follows the longest match convention. For instance, the entity _University of Minnesota_ as a whole (longest match) will belong to the class INSTITUTION. Its component _Minnesota_ is a LOCATION, but as it is part of a larger entity chunk, it will not be identified. 


## Sense information

When possible, senses information are also assigned to entities in the form of one or several WordNet synsets.
